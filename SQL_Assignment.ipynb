        "\n",
        "  Constraints in a database are rules enforced on data to maintain its integrity and accuracy. They ensure that data is entered, updated, and deleted in a way that adheres to predefined business rules and logic. By preventing invalid or inconsistent data from entering the database, constraints help to:\n",
        "\n",
        "  *   Improve data quality: Constraints enforce data validation rules, ensuring data is accurate and reliable.\n",
        "  *   Maintain data consistency: Constraints ensure data conforms to predefined standards, preventing inconsistencies across the database.\n",
        "  *   Prevent data corruption: Constraints help to prevent accidental or intentional corruption of data by enforcing data integrity rules.\n",
        "  *   Enhance data reliability: By enforcing data accuracy and consistency, constraints make the database more reliable for decision-making.\n",

        "  Example: CustomerID in a Customers table.\n",

        "  Example: OrderID in an Orders table referencing CustomerID in Customers.\n",
        "\n",
